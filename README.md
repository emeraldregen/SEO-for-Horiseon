# SEO-for-Horiseon

## Challenge one of the UT Austin Fullstack coding bootcamp.

This website contains refactored aspects of the existing code to meet accessibility standards. The changes make it easier for people with disabilities to access to the website, and improves its position in search engines. The first link is now working, after adding an id tag. I also learned how to consolidate and comment the css file.
